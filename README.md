This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for removing
the boilerplate in setting up a new scala project:

* `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
* `ScalaTest` and `Scalaz`
* SBT simple confguration for `0.12.0` and scala `2.10.0`
* project `name`, `organization` and `version` customizable as variables
* everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
